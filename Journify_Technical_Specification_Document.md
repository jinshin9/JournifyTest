Busy, growth-minded individuals who like to journal and keep the memory of their lifetime. 

## **2\. Key Features**

List the main things your app should do. Be specific but simple.

- Users will be prompted daily to write an entry (in the form of text or checklist), in a fun and engaging way (TBD).  
- Users can write journal entries by typing or using speech-to-text.   
  - Users can format text using text editor features (format, color, font, etc.)   
  - Users can convert speech into text and keep a record of the voice memo.   
  - Users can attach images/videos to an entry.   
- Users can record their mood with each entry.  
- Users can insert a pre-defined prompt or use AI to prompt when writing an entry.   
- Users can create, edit or delete tags (folders, people, location, hashtag) as needed.   
- AI will automatically suggest relevant tags to keep all entries organized, without needing the user to manually categorize them.   
- Users can mark entries as highlights.    
- Users can view highlighted entries in the form of a timeline.  
- Users can view all entries in the form of a calendar or grid.   
- Users can view writing stats and insights generated by AI.   
- Users can engage with the app more with level up and currency systems, as well as gamification (TBD). 

## **3\. Design Preferences**

\- **Look and Feel:** Describe how you want the app to look (e.g., colorful, minimal, dark mode, etc.).

A simple, clean design with a calming theme, available in bright or dark mode. 

\- **Device Support:** Will it work on phones, computers, or both?

The app should work on iOS, Android, and web. 

## **4\. Data Needs**

\- **What information will the app store?:** List things like user accounts, tasks, or other data.

User account data, journal entry data (if user opted in to store data online), journal entry metadata, relationships between entities, tags.

\- **Who can see the data?:** Should data be private to the user or shared?

The user can choose to keep the entries private to themselves (early phase), or share to a public space (future iteration). 

## **5\. Extra Notes**

\- Add any other ideas or features you want.

Ideally I want this app to be different from any other journaling apps out there. I don’t want it to be boring or static, and yet not too overwhelming that it feels like a chore to journal. I’m exploring ways to make it engaging, fun, and make people **want** to do it without forcing it. 

*How to Use This:* Fill out each section with simple sentences. You don’t need to know any coding terms. Just describe what you want the app to do as if you’re explaining it to a friend. Save this as a file called `Technical_Specification_Document.md` in your project folder.
